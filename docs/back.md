## Backtracking

Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique for solving constraint-satisfaction problems by building candidates incrementally and abandoning a candidate as soon as it is determined that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.

### Key idea

Explore the search space depth-first and "backtrack" when a partial solution violates constraints.

### Classic examples

- N-Queens: place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.
- Subset sum / combinations: find subsets that satisfy a target sum.

### N-Queens (high level)

1. Place a queen in the first row, try each column.
2. Move to the next row and place a queen in a non-attacking column.
3. If no column available, backtrack to the previous row and try next option.

Pseudocode (conceptual):

```
function solve(row):
	if row == N: record solution; return
	for col in 0..N-1:
		if safe(row, col):
			place(row, col)
			solve(row + 1)
			remove(row, col)  // backtrack
```

### When it works well

Backtracking is effective when constraints prune large parts of the search space early. Combining backtracking with good heuristics (variable ordering, forward checking) makes it practical for many problems.
